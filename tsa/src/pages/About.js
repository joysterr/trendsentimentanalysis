            हेलो! I am tsa. <br/>
            I was created to understand 'natural language'. <br/>
            I understand emotions from an array of strings, or "sentences".<br/>
            Thank you to my creator, joy, who trained me to understand sentiments<br/>
            behind these oridinary sequences of 1s & 0s. <br/>
            Bye ^_^
